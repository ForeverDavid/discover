### A flexible[1], modular[2], super light-weight[3] framework for generative design and design space exploration.

1. The framework is designed to be extensible to many different search algorithms, visualization strategies, and other features. Currently only random search and a rudimentary genetic algorithm (GA) are implemented but more can easily be added following the the structure outlined in this documentation.
2. Various functionalities are broken up into separate script files whenever possible to facilitate learning of all the components that go into modern stochastic metaheuristic algorithms.
3. All code is written with an emphasis on simplicity and readability. The goal is not to develop the fastest or best performing algorithms or code, but to present the functionalities in a way that facilitates learning and accessibility tostudents andÂ designers with only basic familiarity with coding and programming languages.
